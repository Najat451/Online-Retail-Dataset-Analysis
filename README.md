# Online-Retail-Dataset-Analysis
Analytical SQL Project: Online Retail Dataset Analysis (May 2023)

As part of my data analysis experience, I worked on a project to analyze the Online Retail dataset using SQL.
The objective of this project was to obtain insights about the data and develop targeted marketing strategies for improving sales and customer loyalty.

Firstly, I explored the data and then implemented a Monetary model for customer behavior for product purchasing. Using this model, 
I segmented customers into different groups based on their recency, frequency, and monetary value, which helped in identifying customer groups.

To segment customers, I used the following three main values: Recency, Frequency, and Monetary. 
This segmentation allowed me to gain a better understanding of customer behavior and develop targeted marketing strategies to improve sales and customer loyalty.

For this project, I used various tools and software, including Toad, SQL, and Window Functions. These tools helped me to analyze the data efficiently and effectively.
